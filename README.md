<h3 align="center">by Group 3</h3>

## About The Project
A Hiring/Job Application System made by Group 3 as a final project requirement for the Application Development Course. The Web Application was made using Laravel 9. NUL Job Spot is a web application that acts as a mediator between recruiters and applicants during the early stages of the hiring process. When you need to fill a position and are looking for candidates, you go through the recruitment process. Recruiting is the process of attracting new employees to your business. It's also a piece of software that aids employers in automating the hiring process, from identifying and onboarding prospects to screening resumes. <br><br>The users will greatly benefit from the new recruitment system. The system gives members with a job catalog and information, assisting them in deciding which jobs to apply for. The key users are administrators, members (job searchers), and agencies. 
PS. THIS IS ONLY MADE AS A FINAL PROJECT REQUIREMENT NOT A REAL JOB APPLICATION WEBSITE
